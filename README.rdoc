== Contractor App

This application is meant to be used by contractors that work out of their vehicles.  It will allow the contractor to create proposals and contracts on site for a customer to view and sign, as well as allow the contractor to manage a job cost card, employee hours, and job budgets.  The idea is to save the user much needed time by letting them manage all of these things from one place while on site.
